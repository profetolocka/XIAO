# Reading Data from DHT11 Sensor

# Description  
This program is a demonstration of how to read temperature and humidity data from a **Grove DHT11** module using a **XIAO ESP32-C3** board.

# Libraries  
This project uses the official `ssd1306.py` library, which can be copied manually to the XIAO's file system or installed through Thonny's **package manager**.

The library for reading the DHT11 is included in the MicroPython firmware.
